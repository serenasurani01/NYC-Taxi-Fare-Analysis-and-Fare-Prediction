# Taxi Data Analysis - Ride Patterns and Pricing Dynamics

**Taxi Project** analyzes patterns in taxi rides, examining key metrics such as ride frequency, pricing trends, and geographical distribution. This analysis uses real anonymized taxi data and explores two key areas: **Ride Patterns** and **Pricing Dynamics**.



## 1. Ride Patterns

### What is the geographical distribution of taxi rides, and how does the average fare vary across different regions?

#### **Number of Rides Across the City:**

The blue map highlights the distribution of rides, with the highest concentration in central areas, particularly around business districts and tourist locations. In contrast, suburban areas see fewer rides.

### **Average Fare Across the City:**

The average fare is $25.50. The quartile breakdown is as follows: Q1 is $10.75, Q2 (median) is $18.00, and Q3 is $35.50. This indicates that fares are higher in central, high-demand areas, while lower fares are more prevalent in the outskirts.

Interestingly, while the number of rides in suburban areas is lower, the average fare in these regions is higher, suggesting longer rides with higher fares.



## 2. Pricing Dynamics

### How does dynamic pricing affect customer behavior?

Customers show some degree of price sensitivity, with a correlation value of 0.25 between fare price and ride frequency. In particular, prices tend to rise significantly during peak hours, such as early morning and late afternoon, when demand is higher. This creates a visible pattern in pricing that aligns with commuter rush hours.

### **Fare Trends Over Time:**

The analysis shows that fares are generally higher during peak hours and decrease during off-peak periods, particularly late at night and early afternoon.



## 3. Recommendations & Next Steps

1. **Targeted Promotions in Suburban Areas**: Since rides are less frequent but have higher average fares in suburban areas, targeted marketing efforts could encourage more frequent rides in these regions, potentially increasing overall revenue.

2. **Dynamic Pricing Optimization**: Further optimization of dynamic pricing strategies during peak and off-peak hours could lead to better demand management and improved customer satisfaction.

3. **Ride-Sharing Incentives**: Introducing ride-sharing options or discounts during peak hours could help mitigate the high fares during these times, encouraging more people to use taxi services.
